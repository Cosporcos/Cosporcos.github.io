        <ul>
            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them? The challenges I faced were primarily in kicking off the rust with using html as it has been a number of years since I last touched the language. Funnily enough the other challenge was just finding a picture of myself as I don't like pictures of myself. To overcome these problems it was just to spend a bit playing around with the language, and rewatching the 10/2/24 lecture, as well as digging a few years back in my photo albums for a picture with me in it.</li>
            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know? I wouldn't say that I really learned anything from this assignment as it is all retreading old ground from the high school web dev course I took before.</li>
            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources? I used the 10/2/24 lecture on HTML to refresh my memory on the structure of the language.</li>
